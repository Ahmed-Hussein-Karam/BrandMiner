Intro:
======
Ever wondered where your favorite brands truly shine? 
Brands appear in movies, sports, even in online content - brands are everywhere.

But as companies invest millions to get noticed, here’s the big question:
Are they getting the exposure they paid for?

For advertisers, it is not just about counting logos. It’s about knowing when, where, and how their brand shows up.

Does it capture the viewer's attention… or go completely unnoticed?

Until now, brand tracking has been vague, reactive, and challenging to accurately measure.

And there comes our idea "BrandMiner".

BrandMiner is a Kaggle Notebook that uses the power of Google Generative AI to track brand exposure in video content..
whether visual, in dialogue or textual — so you can get immediate answers to enquiries like:

* What Brands appeared in this video?
* Rank brands by total screen time.
* How many times was the name of brand X spoken in Dialogue?
* Create a 3x3 heatmap grid showing screen positions where Brand X appeared.
* Spot brand exposure violations in this video according to (SLA terms: A,B,C or set of regulations: D,E,F)
* Other Ad-Hook and What-If inqueries

Dataset:

To test BrandMiner, we used MoviePy to generate video content, so that:

- Each frame in the video is a grid, with cells composing together a scene.
- Cells render image sequences that alternate frame by frame, with some car Logos displayed randomly on the screen.
- Some Frames also have subtitles marketing for some car brands in various languages (English - Hindi - Japanese - Arabic - ...)
- The Audio track may also include a mock dialogue where car brand names are mentioned from time to time.
- The average video duration is around 3-4 hours.. this is equivalent to a fairly long movie

BrandMiner empowers businesses, by introducing a seamless way for:

* Brand Exposure Tracking: by gaining valuable insights into brand visibility and reach.
* Brand safety and content moderation: by verifying that brands appear in a safe and approved context.
* Metrics Verification: This allows advertisers to verify that their contractual placements were fully executed, and the content is compliant with SLAs or other regulatory standards
* Integration with billing systems: allowing for automated invoicing based on Brand exposure, to release payments only when placements meet contract requirements.
  This extremely helps advertisers and vendors, who are working on performance-based contracts, to avoid payment disputes.
* Making data-driven decisions to maximize ROI: as it provides a way to quantify the impact of their placements.
* Enhance content monetization: enabling content creators to charge higher rates, as they have a better insight into the value of the brand placements they add.
